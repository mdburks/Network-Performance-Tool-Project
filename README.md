# CPTR-328 Network Tool
This is my network performance tool for my Principles of Networking class. 
This also serves as my service II learning project hence it being uploaded to GitHub. 
This project, including the research journal has taken about 16 hours.
This tool measures network performance by pinging a user's server multiple 
times, reporting the average ping time, packet loss, and success rate of the attempts.
